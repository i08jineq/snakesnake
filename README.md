This is the branch for remaking SnakeSnake.

Goal is: to write cleaner code than prototype branch

Try to:
1 Execute update of snake inside main class. to allow
  -secure execute order
  -allow pause easily (if implement) 

2, remove unneccessary factory pattern (implemented from prototype branch)
  - Instead of using fatory just make a CreateUI method.

3, remove listeners when change the scene or click the buttons
  - to remove events from memory. stop multiple tapping bugs.
